Design a Chat application

Project description

Design a chat interface, like MS teams/Slack/WhatsApp. The interface should display a list of user
messages, the interface has a text field to type in messages and on hitting send the message should be
added to the list of displayed messages. You could think of it as texting yourself in teams. Just the

frontend implementation would suffice, there is not backend component

Features
• Create one or more chats
• Send, receive, and display messages for a chat
• Delete a chat
Note: You can assume there are API stubs for above features and return sample data

Requirements
• Basic chat UI interface
• Properly designed message component – A user message would usually have a user identifier,
time stamp and message content
• Working flow – Typing a message, sending it, and displaying it in the view

Technologies:
You can use any front-end framework and state management library at your choice to implement this
application, React.js is preferrable.

Additional Notes:
• Focusing on UX and bringing it as close to a proper chat experience would be ideal.
• Implementation should factor extensibility, what if we support groups/channels in our
chat?!
• Provide clear instructions on how to run the application
• Need not write a backend component, so state would be cleared off if page is reloaded,
which is expected.
